# Kubernetes Installation Guide

This document is a deployment handoff for DevOps/SRE teams that need to run Gooseherd on their own Kubernetes infrastructure.

It describes the project's current Kubernetes deployment contract:

- the Gooseherd control plane runs as a normal long-lived application inside the cluster
- PostgreSQL is provided in-cluster or as an external managed service
- per-run execution happens in Kubernetes `Job` resources created by Gooseherd itself when `SANDBOX_RUNTIME=kubernetes`

This guide does not ship a Helm chart or raw manifests. It explains what your chart or platform deployment must provide.

## Purpose And Scope

Use this guide when you want a full in-cluster deployment:

- Gooseherd application in Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL reachable from Kubernetes
- Dashboard/API exposed through a cluster `Service` and optionally an `Ingress`
- Gooseherd worker runs executed as Kubernetes `Job` resources

This same deployment model is also the right direction for local `minikube` work.
For local development, treat `minikube` as a lightweight Kubernetes cluster and run Gooseherd inside it.
Do not treat `docker compose up gooseherd` as the primary local path for Kubernetes runtime mode.

This guide is based on the current repository state, especially:

- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.env.example`
- `kubernetes/app.Dockerfile`
- `kubernetes/local/*`
- `src/config.ts`
- `src/index.ts`
- `src/runtime/kubernetes-backend.ts`
- `src/runtime/kubernetes/job-spec.ts`
- `kubernetes/runner.Dockerfile`

    K8s->>Job: Start runner pod
    Job->>GH: Fetch payload from internal API

    Job->>GH: Send events, artifacts, completion
    GH->>DB: Persist final state
    GH-->>User: Show status in dashboard / Slack
```

## What Gets Deployed

From a Kubernetes perspective, Gooseherd consists of these pieces:

1. `Gooseherd control plane`
   Runs the main Node.js application, dashboard, internal runner API, schedulers, Slack integration, and runtime orchestration logic.

2. `PostgreSQL`
   Stores runs, setup state, control-plane metadata, and encrypted secrets.

3. `Persistent app storage`
   Used for `.work` and `data` directories if you want state/artifacts to survive pod restarts.

4. `Runner image`
   A separate container image used for per-run Kubernetes jobs. Built from `kubernetes/runner.Dockerfile`.

5. `Cluster networking`
   Required for:
   - user traffic to the dashboard
   - Gooseherd to reach GitHub, LLM providers, Slack, Sentry, and other external APIs
   - runner jobs to reach Gooseherd's internal API endpoint

## Control Plane And Runner Sequence

    participant Job as Gooseherd Runner Job

    DevOps->>App: Deploy image, values, secrets
    DevOps->>DB: Provide database
    DevOps->>Ingress: Expose dashboard/public URL
    App->>DB: Load config and state
    App->>K8s: Create Secret + Job per run
    K8s->>Job: Launch runner container
    Job->>App: Call /internal/runs/:runId/*
    Job->>App: Report progress and completion
```

## Required Kubernetes Resources

Your deployment should provide at least:

- `Namespace`
  Recommended dedicated namespace for Gooseherd and its runner jobs.

- `Deployment`
  Runs the main Gooseherd control-plane container.

- `Service`
  Exposes the Gooseherd app on port `8787`.

- `Ingress`
  Optional but recommended for dashboard access from outside the cluster.

- `ConfigMap`
  Stores non-secret environment values.

- `Secret`
  Stores sensitive environment variables.

- `PersistentVolumeClaim`
  Recommended for:
  - `/app/.work`
  - `/app/data`

- `PostgreSQL`
  Either:
  - an in-cluster PostgreSQL release/service
  - or an external managed PostgreSQL instance reachable from the cluster

- `ServiceAccount` and `Role`/`RoleBinding`
  Required so the Gooseherd app can create and delete:
  - `jobs`
  - `pods`
  - `secrets`

## Local Minikube Interpretation

If you are validating Kubernetes mode locally with `minikube`, aim for the same shape as production:

- PostgreSQL deployed into `minikube` or otherwise reachable from Gooseherd inside `minikube`
- Gooseherd deployed into `minikube`
- Gooseherd pod authenticating to the Kubernetes API through its pod identity
- runner jobs calling Gooseherd through cluster DNS
- local browser access handled separately through `kubectl port-forward` or `minikube service`

This avoids the main local mismatch of `docker compose`:

- a compose container does not automatically inherit Kubernetes API credentials
- a compose container does not automatically get cluster DNS
- `host.minikube.internal` is convenient for smoke tests, but not the right steady-state service path for a full local Kubernetes deployment

The repository now includes a minimal local deployment bundle for this shape:

- `kubernetes/local/namespace.yaml`
- `kubernetes/local/postgres.yaml`
- `kubernetes/local/gooseherd-rbac.yaml`
- `kubernetes/local/gooseherd-configmap.yaml`
- `kubernetes/local/gooseherd-deployment.yaml`
- `kubernetes/local/gooseherd-service.yaml`
- `scripts/kubernetes/local-up.sh`
- `scripts/kubernetes/local-down.sh`
- `scripts/kubernetes/local-status.sh`

## Images

Two images matter in Kubernetes mode:

### 1. Gooseherd app image

Built from the repository `Dockerfile`.

Important operational note:

- the current app code talks to the Kubernetes API directly when `SANDBOX_RUNTIME=kubernetes`
- the app image does not need a bundled `kubectl` binary for runtime orchestration

That means your production deployment for the main Gooseherd app must provide:

- Kubernetes API credentials available to the process
- network reachability from the app pod to the Kubernetes API server
- RBAC that allows the app service account to manage Gooseherd runner resources

For the local `minikube` bundle in this repository, the helper script builds a lighter local app image from `kubernetes/app.Dockerfile`.
That local image is optimized for Kubernetes control-plane duties only and avoids the heavier browser/sandbox dependencies from the top-level Docker image.
The same helper also bootstraps the setup wizard locally so the dashboard is usable immediately after `npm run k8s:local-up`.

### 2. Runner image

Built from `kubernetes/runner.Dockerfile`.

Default runtime value in code:

- `KUBERNETES_RUNNER_IMAGE=gooseherd/k8s-runner:dev`

For production, build and push your own immutable runner image tag and set `KUBERNETES_RUNNER_IMAGE` explicitly.

## Networking Contract

DevOps must ensure these paths are reachable:

### Inbound

- user/browser -> Gooseherd dashboard `Service` on port `8787`
- optional webhook traffic -> Gooseherd on port `9090` if observer webhooks are enabled

### Outbound from Gooseherd control plane

- Gooseherd -> PostgreSQL
- Gooseherd -> GitHub API
- Gooseherd -> LLM providers
- Gooseherd -> Slack API
- Gooseherd -> Sentry API if Sentry integrations are enabled
- Gooseherd -> Kubernetes API via in-cluster credentials or equivalent kubeconfig

### Outbound from runner jobs

- runner job -> Gooseherd internal API base URL
- runner job -> GitHub
- runner job -> LLM providers used by your selected agent
- runner job -> any repo-specific external services required by validation or tests

### Internal Base URL

`KUBERNETES_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` is critical in Kubernetes mode.

It should point to a cluster-reachable Gooseherd service URL, for example:

```text
http://gooseherd.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8787
```

This is the URL runner jobs use for:

- payload fetch
- artifact target fetch
- event reporting
- cancellation polling
- completion submission

Do not point `KUBERNETES_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` at a public ingress unless that is intentionally how runner jobs should reach the service.

## Storage Contract

### Stateful

Recommended persistent storage:

- PostgreSQL data
- Gooseherd `/app/data`
- Gooseherd `/app/.work`

`/app/.work` stores cloned repositories, logs, and artifacts on the control-plane side.

### Ephemeral

Runner job workspace is currently ephemeral:

- mounted as `/work`
- backed by Kubernetes `emptyDir`

This is created automatically by the current Job spec builder in `src/runtime/kubernetes/job-spec.ts`.

## Non-Secret Environment Values

These values are appropriate for a `ConfigMap` or Helm values file.

At startup, Gooseherd bootstraps or updates the default team record from `DEFAULT_TEAM_NAME` and `DEFAULT_TEAM_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`.

## Secret Environment Values

These values should live in a Kubernetes `Secret`, external secret manager, or sealed-secret workflow.

### Database and encryption

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string used by the app. Usually includes credentials, so treat as secret. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Strongly recommended | Key used for encryption of stored secrets. |

### GitHub

Use either PAT mode or GitHub App mode.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes in PAT mode | GitHub PAT for repo access, pushes, and PRs. |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes in GitHub App mode | PEM private key for GitHub App auth. |

### Jira read access

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JIRA_USER` | Optional | Jira service account identity. For Jira Cloud, use the account email. |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Optional | Jira scoped API token for the service account. |

Gooseherd's Jira reader uses Atlassian's scoped-token URL format (`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudId}/...`). `JIRA_BASE_URL` + `JIRA_USER` + `JIRA_API_TOKEN` define the canonical Jira read-access contract, and `JIRA_CLOUD_ID` can be supplied as an explicit override when auto-discovery from `JIRA_BASE_URL/_edge/tenant_info` is undesirable. The intended consumer is product discovery / work-items logic that already has Slack-thread context and needs to fetch Jira issue content without using Jira as a routing source.

The following GitHub App values are usually not treated as secrets, but many teams still keep them with secrets for convenience:

- `GITHUB_APP_ID`
- `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`

### LLM and agent provider credentials

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Required if your agent/model path uses OpenRouter | LLM provider key. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional | Needed for Claude-based flows. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional | Needed for OpenAI API features. |
| `CODEX_API_KEY` | Optional | Needed if `AGENT_COMMAND_TEMPLATE` uses Codex CLI. |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` | Optional | Needed if `AGENT_COMMAND_TEMPLATE` uses Cursor Agent CLI. |
| `CEMS_API_KEY` | Optional | CEMS memory backend credential. |

### Slack

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Required for Slack mode | Slack bot token. |
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | Required for Slack Socket Mode | Slack app-level token. |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Required for webhook/signing validation | Slack signing secret. |

### Dashboard and access control

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` | Recommended for production | Token-based dashboard access control. |

### Observer and webhook secrets

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OBSERVER_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` | Optional | Per-source webhook secrets for custom adapters. |
| `OBSERVER_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional | GitHub webhook verification secret. |
| `OBSERVER_SENTRY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional | Sentry webhook verification secret. |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Optional | Sentry API credential. |

### Browser verify credentials

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BROWSER_VERIFY_TEST_PASSWORD` | Optional | Password for browser verification test account. |

Depending on internal policy, you may also choose to treat `BROWSER_VERIFY_TEST_EMAIL` as sensitive.

## Minimum Recommended Values For A First Kubernetes Deployment

For a minimal production-like deployment, DevOps should expect to set at least:

### Non-secret

```text
APP_NAME
DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0
DASHBOARD_PORT=8787
DASHBOARD_PUBLIC_URL
RUNNER_CONCURRENCY
WORK_ROOT=/app/.work
DATA_DIR=/app/data
DRY_RUN=false
PIPELINE_FILE=pipelines/pipeline.yml
AGENT_COMMAND_TEMPLATE
AUTO_REVIEW_DEBUG_LOG_MODE=failures
SANDBOX_RUNTIME=kubernetes
KUBERNETES_RUNNER_IMAGE
KUBERNETES_INTERNAL_BASE_URL
KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
KUBERNETES_RUNNER_ENV_SECRET
KUBERNETES_RUNNER_ENV_CONFIGMAP
DEFAULT_BASE_BRANCH
REPO_ALLOWLIST
DEFAULT_TEAM_NAME=default
DEFAULT_TEAM_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=<default-team Slack channel ID>
DEFAULT_TEAM_SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME=#general
```

### Secret

```text
DATABASE_URL
ENCRYPTION_KEY
GITHUB_TOKEN
OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

And additionally, depending on enabled features:

- Slack: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
- GitHub App auth: `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
- dashboard auth: `DASHBOARD_TOKEN`
- browser verify: `BROWSER_VERIFY_TEST_PASSWORD`

## Kubernetes Deployment Expectations

Your Kubernetes deployment should satisfy these expectations:

### Gooseherd application pod

- runs the main app image
- binds on `0.0.0.0:8787`
- mounts persistent storage for:
  - `/app/.work`
  - `/app/data`
- receives env values from `ConfigMap`
- receives secrets from `Secret`
- has outbound internet access to required provider APIs

### RBAC

The Gooseherd application pod needs permissions in `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` to:

- `create`
- `get`
- `list`
- `delete`
- `deletecollection`

for these resource kinds:

- `jobs`
- `pods`
- `secrets`
- `pods/log`

More concretely, the current backend uses:

- `get/list/delete` on `jobs`
- `get/list/delete/deletecollection` on `pods`
- `get` on `pods/log`
- `create/get/delete` on `secrets`

Without these permissions, Kubernetes execution mode will fail.

### Service exposure

The app `Service` should expose:

- port `8787` for dashboard and internal API

If observer webhooks are enabled, also expose:

- port `9090`

### Runner image distribution

Ensure cluster nodes can pull the image referenced by `KUBERNETES_RUNNER_IMAGE`.

This is especially important because the current generated Job spec does not expose settings for:

- `imagePullSecrets`
- `serviceAccountName`
- custom pod security context
- custom resource limits/requests

If your registry is private, you may need one of these operator-side solutions:

- node-level registry auth
- default namespace service account configured with image pull secrets
- code changes to extend the generated Job spec

## Operational Notes For DevOps

### 1. Kubernetes API credentials must exist in the main app container

This is easy to miss. The control-plane process now talks to the Kubernetes API directly in `src/runtime/kubernetes-backend.ts` through the official Node client.

If the process cannot load in-cluster config or another valid kubeconfig, Kubernetes runtime mode will fail even if RBAC is correct.

For real in-cluster deployment, the preferred model is:

- Gooseherd runs inside Kubernetes
- the app pod uses its `ServiceAccount`
- the Node client loads in-cluster credentials automatically

For local `minikube` verification, the model is different:

- if Gooseherd runs on the host, host `kubectl`/`kubeconfig` access is enough
- if Gooseherd runs in a local Docker container, that container must be given a valid kubeconfig plus the referenced `minikube` certificates

The current `docker-compose.yml` in this repo does not mount `~/.kube` or `~/.minikube` by default.
So `docker compose up gooseherd` alone is not sufficient to make the app container Kubernetes-aware.

### 2. `KUBERNETES_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` should usually be cluster DNS

Recommended pattern:

```text
http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8787
```

This avoids hairpinning through external ingress.

### 3. Runner jobs are intentionally lean

Current generated runner jobs include:

- one `Secret` containing `RUN_TOKEN`
- one `Job`
- one container
- one `/work` `emptyDir`

They do not currently include:

- sidecars
- repo-specific database/cache services
- `imagePullSecrets`
- explicit `serviceAccountName`
- resource requests/limits

If your repositories need PostgreSQL, Redis, or other dependencies during validation, those dependencies must already be reachable externally from the runner pod.

### 4. Replace the dummy agent before production use

The repository default remains a safe no-op stub:

```text
bash scripts/dummy-agent.sh {{repo_dir}} {{prompt_file}} {{run_id}}
```

That is suitable for smoke checks, not for real coding runs.

### 5. `DRY_RUN=true` is useful for first deploy verification

Recommended rollout sequence:

1. start with `DRY_RUN=true`
2. verify dashboard, database, GitHub auth, and Kubernetes job creation
3. verify runner can call back into Gooseherd
4. switch to `DRY_RUN=false`

### 6. Local `minikube` smoke checks are valid, but they are not identical to in-cluster deployment

Local `minikube` is good for verifying the API-native execution path:

- Gooseherd talks to the Kubernetes API
- Gooseherd creates `Secret` and `Job`
- the runner pod starts
- the runner reports events and completion
- Gooseherd reconciles terminal state and cleans up resources

But local `minikube` does not prove production-specific concerns such as:

- EKS IAM / IRSA
- private registry auth conventions
- ingress/load balancer behavior
- cluster policies, quotas, and admission controls

For local `minikube`, runner jobs typically reach Gooseherd through:

```text
http://host.minikube.internal:8787
```

For in-cluster deployment, prefer cluster DNS instead of `host.minikube.internal`.

## Post-Deploy Smoke Checklist

After deployment, verify these items in order:

1. Gooseherd pod is healthy and serving `8787`.
2. Dashboard opens through `Service` or `Ingress`.
3. PostgreSQL connectivity works and the app starts without migration/setup failures.
4. Gooseherd can authenticate to GitHub and the configured LLM provider.
5. A dry-run task can be created.
6. Gooseherd creates a Kubernetes `Secret` and `Job` in `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE`.
7. The runner pod starts successfully and can pull `KUBERNETES_RUNNER_IMAGE`.
8. The runner can reach `KUBERNETES_INTERNAL_BASE_URL`.
9. The run reaches terminal state and reports completion back to Gooseherd.
10. Gooseherd cleans up the per-run `Job`, `Pod`, and `Secret`.

## Current Project Caveats

Current important caveats:

- no Helm chart is shipped in this repository
- no raw Kubernetes manifests are shipped for the full application deployment
- generated runner jobs are intentionally minimal
- runner job spec currently has no built-in support for:
  - `imagePullSecrets`
  - `serviceAccountName`
  - resource requests/limits
  - sidecars for repo dependencies

So the correct mental model is:

- Gooseherd already contains the application logic for Kubernetes-backed execution
- DevOps still needs to supply the surrounding Kubernetes deployment package and cluster conventions
